Multi-dimensional Knap Sack Problem

## Constructive algorithm
This algorithm is based on two phases:
- First phase intend to find a feasible solution. Items which less increase resource use (for b[i]>0) and more decrease resource use for b[i]<0.
- Second phase, if a feasible solution is found, intend to improve the solution. Items which more increase objective function in worse case.
